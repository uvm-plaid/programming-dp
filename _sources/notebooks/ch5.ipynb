    "As we mentioned when we dicussed the Laplace mechanism, the amount of noise necessary to ensure differential privacy for a given query depends on the *sensitivity* of the query. Roughly speaking, the sensitivity of a function reflects the amount the function's output will change when its input changes. Recall that the Laplace mechanism defines a mechanism $F(x)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "F(x) = f(x) + \\textsf{Lap}(\\frac{s}{\\epsilon})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f(x)$ is a deterministic function (the query), $\\epsilon$ is the privacy parameter, and $s$ is the sensitivity of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a function $f : \\mathcal{D} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ mapping datasets ($\\mathcal{D}$) to real numbers, the *global sensitivity* of $f$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "GS(f) = \\max_{x, x': d(x,x') <= 1} |f(x) - f(x')|\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $d(x, x')$ represents the *distance* between two datasets $x$ and $x'$, and we say that two datasets are *neighbors* if their distance is 1 or less. How this distance is defined has a huge effect on the definition of privacy we obtain, and we'll discuss the distance metric on datasets in detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of global sensitivity says that for *any two* neighboring datasets $x$ and $x'$, the difference between $f(x)$ and $f(x')$ is at most $GS(f)$. This measure of sensitivity is called \"global\" because it is independent of the actual dataset being queried (it holds for *any* choice of neighboring $x$ and $x'$). Another measure of sensitivity, called *local sensitivity*, fixes one of the datasets to be the one being queried; we will consider this measure in a later section. For now, when we say \"sensitivity,\" we mean global sensitivity."

    "## Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance metric $d(x,x')$ described earlier can be defined in many different ways. Intuitively, the distance between two datasets should be equal to 1 (i.e. the datasets are neighbors) if they differ in the data of exactly one individual. This idea is easy to formalize in some contexts (e.g. in the US Census, each individual submits a single response containing their data) but extremely challenging in others (e.g. location trajectories, social networks, and time-series data).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common formal definition for datasets containing rows is to consider the number of rows which differ between the two. When each individual's data is contained in a single row, this definition often makes sense. Formally, this definition of distance is encoded as a *symmetric difference* between the two datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "d(x, x') = | x - x' \\cup x' - x |\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular definition has several interesting and important implications:\n",
    "- If $x'$ is constructed from $x$ by *adding one row*, then $d(x,x') = 1$\n",
    "- If $x'$ is constructed from $x$ by *removing one row*, then $d(x,x') = 1$\n",
    "- If $x'$ is constructed from $x$ by *modifying one row*, then $d(x,x') = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, adding or removing a row results in a neighboring dataset; *modifying* a row results in a dataset at distance *2*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular definition of distance results in what is typically called *unbounded differential privacy*. Many other definitions are possible, including one called *bounded differential privacy* in which modifying a single row in a dataset *does* result in a neighboring dataset. \n",

We could claim, for example, that the sensitivity is 125 - but it may turn out that the row we add to the database corresponds to a person who is over 125 years old, which would violate our claim. For any number we come up with, it's possible for the added row to violate our claim.\n",

In this specific domain - ages - there's a very reasonable upper bound on how old someone can be. The oldest person ever lived to be [122 years old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people), so an upper bound of 125 seems reasonable.\n",

When lower and upper bounds do exist, the sensitivity of a summation query is equal to the **difference between them**. In the next section, we will see a technique called *clipping* for enforcing bounds when none exist, so that summation queries with unbounded sensitivity can be converted into queries with bounded sensitivity."

    "It's clear from this histogram that nobody in this particular dataset is over 90, so an upper bound of 90 would suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that **this approach does not satisfy differential privacy**. If we pick our clipping bounds by looking at the data, then the bounds themselves might reveal something about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, clipping bounds are decided either by using a property of the dataset that can be known without looking at the data (e.g. that the dataset contains ages, which are likely to lie between 0 and 125), or by performing differentially private queries to evaluate different choices for the clipping bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the second approach, we typically set the lower bound to 0 and slowly increase the upper bound until the query's output stops changing (meaning we haven't included any new data by increasing the bound). For example, let's try computing the sum of ages for clipping bounds from 0 to 100, using the Laplace mechanism for each one to ensure differential privacy:"

    "This approach allows us to test a huge range of possible bounds with a small number of queries, but at the expense of less precision in determining the perfect bound. As the upper bound gets really large, the noise will start to overwhelm the signal - notice how the sum fluctuates wildly for the largest clipping parameters! The key is to look for a region of the graph which is relatively smooth (meaning low noise) and also not increasing (meaning the clipping bound is sufficient). Here, this occurs at roughly $2^8 = 256$, which is a reasonable approximation of the upper bound we derived earlier."
