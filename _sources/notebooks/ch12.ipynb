We'll focus on a kind of *supervised learning* problem: given a set of *labeled training examples* $\\{(x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_n, y_n)\\}$, in which $x_i$ is called the *feature vector* and $y_i$ is called the *label*, train a *model* $\\theta$ which can *predict* the label for a new feature vector which was not present in the training set. Each $x_i$ is typically a vector of real numbers which describe the features of a training example, and the $y_i$s are drawn from a predefined set of *classes* (usually expressed as integers) that examples can be drawn from. A *binary* classifier has two classes (usually either 1 and 0, or 1 and -1)."

    "Gradient descent is an approach that makes the loss smaller by updating the model according to the [*gradient*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) of the loss. The gradient is like a multi-dimensional derivative: for a function with multi-dimensional inputs (like our loss function above), the gradient tells you how fast the function's output is changing with respect to *each* dimension of the input. If the gradient is positive in a particular dimension, that means the function's value will *increase* if we increase the model's weight for that dimension; we want the loss to *decrease*, so we should modify our model by *negating* the gradient - i.e. do the *opposite* of what the gradient says. Since we move the model in the opposite direction of the gradient, this is called *descending* the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we iteratively perform many steps of this descent process, we slowly get closer and closer to the model which minimizes the loss. This algorithm is called *gradient descent*. Let's see how this looks in Python; first, we'll define the gradient function."

This isn't difficult to do - we can compute the sum of the per-example gradients, rather than their average, and divide by a noisy count later. Second, we need to bound the sensitivity of each per-example gradient. There are two basic approaches for this: we can either analyze the gradient function itself (as we have done with previous queries) to determine its worst-case global sensitivity, or we can *enforce* a sensitivity by clipping the output of the gradient function (as we did in sample and aggregate).\n",

    "We can use the same trick to bound the L2 sensitivity of our gradient function. We'll need to define a function which \"clips\" a vector so that it has L2 norm within a desired range. We can accomplish this by *scaling* the vector: if we divide the vector elementwise by its L2 norm, then the resulting vector will have an L2 norm of 1. If we want to target a particular clipping parameter $b$, we can multiply the scaled vector by $b$ to scale it back up to have L2 norm $b$. We want to avoid modifying vectors that already have L2 norm below $b$; in that case, we just return the original vector. We can use `np.linalg.norm` with the parameter `ord=2` to calculate the L2 norm of a vector."

Furthermore, we're no longer forced to compute per-example gradients so that we can clip them; instead, we can compute all of the gradients at once, which can be done very efficiently (this is a commonly used trick in machine learning, but we won't discuss it here).\n",

Since our differentially private algorithm adds noise to the gradient, this can also affect accuracy - the noise can cause our algorithm to move in *the wrong direction* during training, and actually make the model *worse*.\n",

This is true, but there's also a slightly more subtle tradeoff which occurs because of the composition we need to consider when we perform many iterations of the algorithm: more iterations means a larger privacy cost. In the standard gradient descent algorithm, more iterations generally result in a better model. In our differentially private version, more iterations can make the model *worse*, since we have to use a smaller $\\epsilon$ for each iteration, and so the scale of the noise goes up. In differentially private machine learning, it's important (and sometimes, very challenging) to strike the right balance between the number of iterations used and the scale of the noise added.\n",
