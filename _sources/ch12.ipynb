Each $x_i$ is typically a vector of real numbers which describe the features of a training example, and the $y_i$s are drawn from a predefined set of *classes* (usually expressed as integers) that examples can be drawn from.

This isn't difficult to do - we can compute the noisy sum of the per-example gradients, rather than their average, and divide by a noisy count later. Second, we need to bound the sensitivity of each per-example gradient. There are two basic approaches for this: we can either analyze the gradient function itself (as we have done with previous queries) to determine its worst-case global sensitivity, or we can *enforce* a sensitivity by clipping the output of the gradient function (as we did in sample and aggregate).\n",

    "### Gradient Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when we implemented sample and aggregate, we enforced a desired sensitivity on a function $f$ with unknown sensitivity by clipping its output. The sensitivity of $f$ was:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\lvert f(x) - f(x') \\rvert\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "After clipping with parameter $b$, this becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\lvert \\mathsf{clip}(f(x), b) - \\mathsf{clip}(f(x'),b) \\rvert\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, $\\mathsf{clip}(f(x), b) = b$, and $\\mathsf{clip}(f(x'),b) = 0$, so the sensitivity of the clipped result is exactly $b$ (the value of the clipping parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same trick to bound the $L2$ sensitivity of our gradient function. We'll need to define a function which \"clips\" a vector so that it has $L2$ norm within a desired range. We can accomplish this by *scaling* the vector: if we divide the vector elementwise by its $L2$ norm, then the resulting vector will have an $L2$ norm of 1. If we want to target a particular clipping parameter $b$, we can multiply the scaled vector by $b$ to scale it back up to have $L2$ norm $b$. We want to avoid modifying vectors that already have $L2$ norm below $b$; in that case, we just return the original vector. We can use `np.linalg.norm` with the parameter `ord=2` to calculate the $L2$ norm of a vector."

    "### Sensitivity of the Gradient\n",

    "Our previous approach is very general, since it makes no assumptions about the behavior of the gradient. Sometimes, however, we *do* know something about the behavior of the gradient. In particular, a large class of useful gradient functions (including the gradient of the logistic loss, which we're using here) are *Lipschitz continuous* - meaning they have bounded global sensitivity. Formally, it is possible to show that:\n",

    "Clipping the training examples instead of the gradients has two advantages. First, it's often easier to estimate the scale of the training data (and thus to pick a good clipping parameter) than it is to estimate the scale of the gradients you'll compute during training. Second, it's computationally more efficient: we can clip the training examples *once*, and re-use the clipped training data every time we train a model; with gradient clipping, we need to clip each gradient during training. Furthermore, we're no longer forced to compute per-example gradients so that we can clip them; instead, we can compute all of the gradients at once, which can be done very efficiently (this is a commonly used trick in machine learning, but we won't discuss it here).\n",

    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen that the number of iterations has a big effect on the accuracy of the model we get, since more iterations can get you closer to the minimum of the loss. Since our differentially private algorithm adds noise to the gradient, this can also affect accuracy - the noise can cause our algorithm to move in *the wrong direction* during training, and actually make the model *worse*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's reasonable to expect that smaller values of $\\epsilon$ will result in less accurate models (since this has been the trend in every differentially private algorithm we have seen so far). This is true, but there's also a slightly more subtle tradeoff which occurs because of the composition we need to consider when we perform many iterations of the algorithm: more iterations means a larger privacy cost. In the standard gradient descent algorithm, more iterations generally result in a better model. In our differentially private version, more iterations can make the model *worse*, since we have to use a smaller $\\epsilon$ for each iteration, and so the scale of the noise goes up. In differentially private machine learning, it's important (and sometimes, very challenging) to strike the right balance between the number of iterations used and the scale of the noise added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a small experiment to see how the setting of $\\epsilon$ effects the accuracy of our model. We'll train a model for several values of $\\epsilon$, using 20 iterations each time, and graph the accuracy of each model against the $\\epsilon$ value used in training it."

In this particular scenario, leveraging this strategy, we manage to incur negligible time cost for the use of differential privacy."
