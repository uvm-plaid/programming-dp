We want to know how many *possible identities* are returned for each data record in the dataset. The following histogram shows the number of records with each number of possible identities. The results show that we can uniquely identify almost 7,000 of the data records (out of about 32,000), and an additional 10,000 data records are narrowed down to two possible identities."
