    "```{admonition} Learning Objectives\n",
    "After reading this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Define the local model of differential privacy and contrast it with the central model\n",
    "- Define and implement the randomized response and unary encoding mechanisms\n",
    "- Describe the accuracy implications of these mechanisms and the challenges of the local model\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only considered the *central model* of differential privacy, in which the sensitive data is collected centrally in a single dataset. In this setting, we assume that the *analyst* is malicious, but that there is a *trusted data curator* who holds the dataset and correctly executes the differentially private mechanisms the analyst specifies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setting is often not realistic. In many cases, the data curator and the analyst are *the same*, and no trusted third party actually exists to hold the data and execute mechanisms. In fact, the organizations which collect the most sensitive data tend to be exactly the ones we *don't* trust; such organizations certainly can't function as trusted data curators.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to the central model of differential privacy is the *local model of differential privacy*, in which data is made differentially private before it leaves the control of the data subject. For example, you might add noise to your data *on your device* before sending it to the data curator. In the local model, the data curator does not need to be trusted, since the data they collect *already* satisfies differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The local model thus has one huge advantage over the central model: data subjects don't need to trust anyone else but themselves. This advantage has made it popular in real-world deployments, including the ones by [Google](https://github.com/google/rappor) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Differential_Privacy_Overview.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the local model also has a significant drawback: the accuracy of query results in the local model is typically *orders of magnitude lower* for the same privacy cost as the same query under central differential privacy. This huge loss in accuracy means that only a small handful of query types are suitable for local differential privacy, and even for these, a large number of participants is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll see two mechanisms for local differential privacy. The first is called *randomized response*, and the second is called *unary encoding*."

    "## Randomized Response\n",
    "\n",
    "[Randomized response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response) is a mechanism for local differential privacy which was first proposed in a 1965 [paper by S. L. Warner](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2283137?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). At the time, the technique was intended to improve bias in survey responses about sensitive issues, and it was not originally proposed as a mechanism for differential privacy (which wouldn't be invented for another 40 years). After differential privacy was developed, statisticians realized that this existing technique *already* satisfied the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dwork and Roth present a variant of randomized response, in which the data subject answers a \"yes\" or \"no\" question as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flip a coin\n",
    "2. If the coin is heads, answer the question truthfully\n",
    "3. If the coin is tails, flip another coin\n",
    "4. If the second coin is heads, answer \"yes\"; if it is tails, answer \"no\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The randomization in this algorithm comes from the two coin flips. As in all other differentially private algorithms, this randomization creates uncertainty about the true answer, which is the source of privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, this randomized response algorithm satisfies $\\epsilon$-differential privacy for $\\epsilon = \\log(3) = 1.09$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the algorithm for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" question: \"is your occupation 'Sales'?\" We can flip a coin in Python using `np.random.randint(0, 2)`; the result is either a 0 or a 1."
